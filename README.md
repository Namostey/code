Student Loan Platform
This project is a decentralized student loan platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows borrowers to request loans, lenders to fund loans, and borrowers to repay loans. The project consists of a smart contract (StudentLoanPlatform.sol) and a React.js frontend that interacts with the smart contract.

Features
Loan Request: Borrowers can request a loan specifying the amount and duration.
Loan Funding: Lenders can fund a loan by contributing the requested amount.
Loan Repayment: Borrowers can repay the loan within the specified duration.
Loan Default: Loans that are not repaid within the specified duration are considered defaulted.
Interest Rate: The interest rate is dynamically calculated based on the loan duration.
Withdrawal: Lenders can withdraw their contributions plus interest once the loan is fully repaid.
Smart Contract Overview
The StudentLoanPlatform smart contract is written in Solidity and deployed on the Ethereum network. It handles the core logic of the platform, including loan management, funding, repayment, and lender withdrawal.

Key Functions
requestLoan(uint256 amount, uint256 duration): Allows a borrower to request a loan.
fundLoan(uint256 loanId): Allows a lender to fund a loan.
repayLoan(uint256 loanId): Allows a borrower to repay a loan.
withdrawFunds(uint256 loanId): Allows a lender to withdraw their funds plus interest after a loan is repaid.
checkLoanDefault(uint256 loanId): Checks if a loan has defaulted based on the end time and repayment status.
Events
LoanRequested(uint256 loanId, address borrower, uint256 amount, uint256 interestRate, uint256 duration)
LoanFunded(uint256 loanId, address lender, uint256 amount)
LoanRepaid(uint256 loanId, uint256 amountRepaid)
LoanDefaulted(uint256 loanId)
Frontend Overview
The frontend is a React.js application that interacts with the smart contract using Web3.js. It provides a simple UI for borrowers and lenders to interact with the platform.
